<div> <p>Podcasts are more popular than they ever have been, and that popularity will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.  Your audience is out there, and your marketing strategy should be designed to lead them directly to your door.  What they want is accountability and a professional response if you make a mistake or let them down.  As we mentioned above, SMART goals are necessary for any successful marketing strategy.  <br><br>  Regularly, review the number of opened emails, how well your website and content show up in search results, whether comments are made to your social media post.  But what are the best ways to use social media for your accounting business?  Video marketing is one of the most effective types of online presence and is an idea that can really set your accounting firm apart from the rest.  <br><br>  You may also want to allow leads to opt-in for text messaging, which can be highly effective as a means of nurturing leads.  You should feel free to get creative.  It is also an effective way to turn casual subscribers into new clients for your firm because you can use your emails to explain your services and demonstrate why they should choose your accounting firm over others in the area.  <br><br>  By consistently producing informative blog posts, social media content, videos, and infographics, accounting firms can establish a robust online presence and position themselves as thought leaders.  Make sure that your profile is complete and up to date, and that you’re regularly posting relevant content.  Write about the topics that you know are relevant to prospective clients and also reflect your areas of expertise.  <br><br></p></div>
